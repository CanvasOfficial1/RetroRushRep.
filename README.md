Hello! I (and a couple of friends) are working on a game called Retro Rush. It is a platformer type style game and is a very big project! Our challenge was to only use websites that are made by or are github. So, for the sprites, we are using Piskel.com It is a very good editor that is free. The coding will be done on github.
